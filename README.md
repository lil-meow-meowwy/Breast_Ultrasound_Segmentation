# Breast_Ultrasound_Segmentation
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for multiclass segmentation of breast ultrasound images. Using the BUSI dataset, the model identifies three tissue types: normal, benign, and malignant. The project involves data preprocessing, adapting the U-Net architecture, and evaluating performance with metrics.
